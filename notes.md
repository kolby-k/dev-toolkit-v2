## TODO

- Setup Routing
  -- Replace header anchor tags with Link tags

- Install react icon package
  -- replace search text with an icon to toggle search input

- Use a callback function in Home route
  -- filter tools based on search value prop; pass prop to toolList from Home; update using callback prop in Header

- Define constant TOOLS with real labels,descriptions,href,iconLabel
  -- use undefined href for tools that are not yet complete

- Plan tool components
  -- what components can be shared across tools? Otherwise remaining components need to be specialized for a specific tool, so try to plan and make as many re-usable components first.

- Implement tool logic (Page, Components, Style)
  -- Tool 1: JSON formatter
  -- Tool 2: Character counter
  -- Tool 3: Text Compare
  -- Tool 4: URL Encode / Decode
  -- Tool 5: Base64 Encode / Decode
  -- Tool 6: JSON Generator- give key names and data types, then generate random values that align.
  -- Tool 7: JSON Snippets: save JSON snippets to easily copy and paste for later.
  -- Tool 8: JWT Decode / Generator
  -- Tool 9: API Key Generator
  -- Tool 10: Unix Timestamp to Readable time
  -- Tool 11: OKLCH Color Picker
  -- Tool 12: Character Replace- easily replace non UTF-8/Ascii chars from text by selecting a bad value to replace with new good value.
